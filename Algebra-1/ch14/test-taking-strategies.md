## Chapter 14: Test-Taking Strategies

### 14.1 Time Management

#### Don't Rush

The Algebra I Regents exam is three hours long. Even though are permitted to leave after one and a half hours, to get the best grade possible, stay until the end of the exam.

#### Do the Test Twice

The best way to protect against careless errors is to do the entire test twice and compare the answers you got the first time to the answers you got the second time. For any answers that don't agree, do a "tie breaker" third time.

Redoing the test and comparing your answers is much more effetive than simply "looking over" your work. People tend to skim past careless errors when looking over their work.

#### Bring a Watch

Without knowing how much time is left, you might rush and make careless errors.
