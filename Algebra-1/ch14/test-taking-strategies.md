## Chapter 14: Test-Taking Strategies

### 14.1 Time Management

#### Don't Rush

The Algebra I Regents exam is three hours long. Even though are permitted to leave after one and a half hours, to get the best grade possible, stay until the end of the exam.

#### Do the Test Twice

The best way to protect against careless errors is to do the entire test twice and compare the answers you got the first time to the answers you got the second time. For any answers that don't agree, do a "tie breaker" third time.

Redoing the test and comparing your answers is much more effetive than simply "looking over" your work. People tend to skim past careless errors when looking over their work.

#### Bring a Watch

Without knowing how much time is left, you might rush and make careless errors.

### 14.2 Know How to Get Partial Credit

#### Know the Structure of the Exam

There is no partial credit for Multiple-Choice questions.

For free-response questions with no multiple-choice and you can get partial credit for these questions.

#### Explaining Your Reasoning

The grader is expecting a few clearly written sentences.

You don't want to write too little since the grader needs to see that you understand why you did the different steps you did to solve the equation.

You don't want to write too much because if anything you write is not accurate, points can be deducted.

#### Computational Errors vs. Conceptual Errors

This is an example of a computational error.

```
x - 1 = 2
+1 = +1
x = 4
```

This is an example of a conceptual error.

```
x - 1 =2
-1 = -1
x = 1
```

Either error might just be careless, but the conceptual error is the one that gets the harsher deduction.

### 14.3 Know Your Calculator

#### Which Calculator Should You Use?

#### Clearing the Memory

#### Use Parentheses

#### Using the ANS Feature

### 14.4 Use the Reference Sheet

In the back of the Algebra I Regents booklet is a reference sheet with 17 conversion facts, like inches to centimeters and quarts to pints, and also 17 formulas.

The quadratic formula and the arithmetic sequence formula are the two that will come in the handiest.
